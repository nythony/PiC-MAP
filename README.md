PiC-MAP - Capitalizing on Project Management and Communication while minimizing issues!

Hello!

This is a web application that acts as a digital Kanban board. Users are able to create an account, create a project, and then allow
others to join the project by sharing project credentials. Each project comes with premade Kanban boards for requirement management 
and issue tracking as well as the option to create additional boards. Additionally, each project also comes with its own chat room.

The application was built using NodeJs and simple HTML/CSS. Live display of information for all members watching a board is 
possible through the use of Socket.io.
